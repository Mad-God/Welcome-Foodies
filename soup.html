              <!-- Soup is a traditional Japanese soy-based soup made from a stock
              called dashi, miso paste, and various additional ingredients
              such as seaweed or tofu. It is estimated that more than 70% of
              Japeanese people consume the soup for breakfast, although it is
              commonly available at any time of the day.
              <br /><br />
              In Japanese restaurants in the United States, miso soup is often
              offered as an appetizer. The soup is thought to have medicinal
              properties, as it alkalizes the blood and revives the nervous
              system. The main ingredient is called miso - a combination of
              rice, salt, water, and fermented soybeans, shaped into a paste
              that is similar to peanut butter in texture. -->

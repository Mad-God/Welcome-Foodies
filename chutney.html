              <!-- Whether Indians are enjoying tandoori chicken or aloo paratha,
              no meal is complete without the flavorful chutneys - India's
              national condiments. These fresh homemade relishes consist of
              pickled or stewed fruit and vegetables that are cut into small
              chunks, then delicately seasoned with a variety of spices such
              as cumin, cardamom, tamarind, ginger, and turmeric.
              <br /><br />They are typically served in small, round bowls and
              consumed along with the main dish. Chutney's role is to cool the
              palate and bring even more flavors and colors to the table. Most
              families take great pride in their homemade chutneys, their
              houses decorated with rows upon rows of jars that were left to
              mature in the sun on windowsills. -->

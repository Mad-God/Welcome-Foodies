                Spring rolls are traditional Chinese snacks consisting of thin
                sheets of dough that are filled with various ingredients, then
                deep-fried in hot oil. Some of the more common ingredients for
                the filling include shredded pork, shrimp, mushrooms, and
                cabbage. <br /><br />
                These flavorful snacks are commonly served as an appetizer,
                accompanied by numerous dips, tea, or coffee. Originally, spring
                rolls were called spring dish, symbolizing the beginning of
                Spring. Spring dish used to be sent to friends or relatives as a
                spring present and a blessing, and they were usually filled only
                with vegetables and fruits.

              The most popular food of the Southern cuisine, fried chicken is
              the theme of many arguments where everyone involved seems to
              have a favorite, be it what their mothers used to make, a cult
              roadside eatery, or a bygone restaurant. However, it is
              universally agreed that the meat must be moist, succulent, and
              tender, coated with a crunchy, golden-brown crust. <br /><br />
              It all started during the colonization period, when Scottish
              immigrants settled in the South, bringing their fried chicken
              recipes along. The African slaves then introduced new seasonings
              and spices, and the dish quickly gained popularity. Typical
              seasonings include salt, pepper, and hot chiles, and the pieces
              of meat should be edible by hand so that the consumer can bite
              both the crust and the meat at the same time.

              <Ol>

                <li>Briefly stir together the warm water and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer. (Or see notes below
                  about how to make the dough by hand.) Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and give it a quick stir,
                  then let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes until the yeast is foamy.</li>
                <li>Add the flour, yogurt, salt, baking powder, and egg. Using the dough attachment, mix the dough on
                  medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes until smooth</li>
                <li>Remove dough from the mixing bowl and use your hands to shape it into a ball. Grease the mixing bowl
                  (or a separate bowl) lightly with cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover
                  it with a damp towel. Place the bowl in a warm location (I set mine by a sunny window) and let it rise
                  for 1 hour until the dough has nearly doubled in size</li>
                <li>During the last 10 minutes of the dough’s rise time, heat the butter in a small sauté pan over
                  medium heat until melted. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Remove the pan from
                  heat and stir in some chopped herbs, if desired. (You can also strain out the garlic chunks if you
                  prefer the garlic butter to be completely smooth.)</li>
                <li>Once the dough is ready to go, transfer it to a floured work surface and shape it into an even(ish)
                  circle. Cut the dough into 8 equally-sized wedges and roll each wedge into a ball with your hands.
                  Then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough ball until it forms an oval about 1/4-inch thick. (I
                  recommend multi-tasking this process — rolling out the next dough ball while you cook one on the
                  stove.)</li>
                <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet or non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat until it is nice and
                  hot. Add a piece of the rolled-out dough to the pan and cook for 1 minute, or until the top of the
                  dough begins to bubble and the bottom turns lightly golden. Flip the dough and cook on the second side
                  for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom is golden as well, then transfer the dough to a clean plate.
                  (If you are making garlic naan, brush one or both side(s) of the dough with the garlic butter once the
                  naan has cooked.) Sprinkle the naan with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired. Then lightly cover the
                  naan with a clean towel so that it stays warm. Repeat with remaining dough until all of the naan
                  pieces are cooked, adjusting the heat of the pan if needed to keep it hot (but not overly-hot so that
                  it burns the bread).</li>

              <!-- Naan is a unique and popular flatbread with a chewy texture that
              has its roots in India. The first documented traces of naan are
              found in the 1300 AD notes of Amir Kushrau, an Indo-Persian
              poet. Its name comes from the Persian word for bread. Naan was
              originally made in two versions at the Imperial Court in Delhi -
              naan-e-tunuk (light bread) and naan-e-tanuri (baked on the stone
              walls of a tandoor oven). <br /><br />
              It consists of white flour, yeast, eggs, milk, salt, and sugar,
              baked in a tandoor oven. Its typical tear-drop shape is achieved
              by the way the dough droops as it cooks on the tandoor walls.
              Many Indian villages had a communal tandoor, placed in the
              middle of the village so that all the locals could bake naan. -->

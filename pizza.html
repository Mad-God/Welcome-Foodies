                Italy’s most emblematic culinary creation, the genuine pizza
                Napoletana is made with just a few simple ingredients and
                prepared in only two variations – marinara, the basic Neapolitan
                pizza topped with a tomato-based sauce flavored with garlic and
                oregano, and margherita, which is topped with tomatoes,
                mozzarella, and fresh basil leaves, a delicious combination
                whose colors are said to represent the Italian flag.
                <br /><br />
                The crust is very thin at the base, and the dough puffs up on
                the sides, which results in airy crust that should have typical
                charred 'leopard spots' if baked properly. The origins of this
                iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when
                what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by
                Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his
                treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples.
